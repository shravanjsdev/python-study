# Basics of file handling

# OS like windows and MAC OS can read and understand almost all file formats like text audio/video gif
# But python can read and supports only 2 formats: Text and Binary
# Text: Files that contains text characters
# Binary: Files that contains characters that are not text, (all other formats are converted to binary 0,1 formats)

# Operations that can be performed on file are called as C R U D operation
# - Create
# - Read
# - Update
# - Delete

# Python file handling system
# Things that are done with :
# 1. Create file
# 2. Open file
# 3. WORK ( C R U D, Move, Copy etc..)
# 4. Close file

# Creating file
# Creating file can be done by the user either manually (in GUI or in CLI interface), or by using python
