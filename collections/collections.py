# Collections in python

# They are the container datatypes, basically there are 4 container datatypes in python
# They are used for storing a collection of data
# There are 4 types of container collection datatypes in python:
# 1. List
# 2. Tuple
# 3. Set
# 4. Dictionary

# Python has another datatype named as collection itself, apart from the other 4 datatypes.
# The Collection datatype has specialised data structures, which overcomes the drawbacks of those 4 collection datatypes
# Such as cannot accessible using index number, duplicate entries not allowed, unordered.
# Those 4 container datatypes are already installed and auto imported in python so you don't need to install/import it
# But this collection datatype, is installed in python like others but is not imported, we need to import while using it

# Types of collection datatypes:
# 1. namedtuple
# 2. chainmap
# 3. deque
# 4. counter
# 5. ordereddict
# 6. defaultdict
# 7. userdict
# 8. userlist
# 9. userstring
