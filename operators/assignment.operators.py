# Assignment operators

# 1. Assign
x = 10
print("value of x is ", str(x))

# 2. Add and
x = 10
x += 10  # x = x + 10
print("value of x+=10 is", x)

# 3. Subtract and assign
x = 10
x -= 10  # x = x - 10
print("value of x-=10 is", x)

# 4. Multiply and assign
x = 10
x *= 10  # x = x * 10
print("value of x*=10 is ", x)

# 5. Division and assign
x = 10
x /= 10  # x = x / 10
print("value of x/=10 is ", x)

# 6. Modulus and assign
x = 10
x %= 10  # x = x % 10
print("value of x%=10 is", x)

# 7. Exponent and assign
x = 10
x **= 10  # x = x ** 10
print("value of x**=10 is", x)

# 8. Float division and assign
x = 10
x //= 10  # x = x // 10
print("value of x//=10 is", x)

# Should know the exact usage and name of the below 3 operators

# 9. OR and assign
x = 25
x |= 15  # x = x | 15
print("value of x|=10 is", x)

# 10. Cap and assign
x = 25
x ^= 15  # x = x ^ 15
print("value of x^=10 is", x)

# 11. AND and assign
x = 25
x &= 15  # x = x & 15
print("value of x&=10 is", x)
