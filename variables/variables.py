# Variables are used to store values in the memory, they are the memory

"""
Unlike programming languages like C and C++, variable declaration is not allowed in python
It should be assigned values at the time of its usage, it shouldn't be declared empty
Variables are generic, no need for mentioned variables data type
# At the time of definition variables take the data type of value automatically
# They are case sensitive
